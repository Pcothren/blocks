Welcome to the _Dear PyGui_ wiki! Always in construction - feel free to edit and contribute!

_Dear PyGui_ is an easy-to-use, dynamic, GPU-Accelerated, cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI) framework for Python. As an extended wrapping of [[Dear ImGui | https://github.com/ocornut/imgui]], _Dear PyGui_ is highly performant. It is written primarily in C/C++ and uses your GPU for rendering.

Features include traditional GUI elements to display text, images and various controls, such as buttons, radio buttons, and menus and various methods to create a functional and beautiful layout. Additionally, it offers incredibly dynamic charts, tables, drawings and tools for application development, such as built-in documentation, logging, and debugger.

As a GUI toolkit, it is well suited for creating simple user interfaces to wrap basic command line interfaces as well as to developing complex and demanding graphical interfaces. It offers a solid framework for developing science, engineering, games, data science and other applications that require fast and interactive interfaces.

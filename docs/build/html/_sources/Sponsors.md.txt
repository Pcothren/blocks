### Software doesn't maintain itself

Your contributions are keeping this project alive. The library is available under a free and permissive license, but continued maintenance and development are a full-time endeavor which we would like to sustain and grow. In addition to maintenance and stability there are many desirable features yet to be added.

Thank you to all of our past and present supporters!
